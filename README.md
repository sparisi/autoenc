Simple implementation of (convolutional) autoencoders in Keras and Tensorflow.  
The code is commented and pretty much-self explanatory.

Data stores
* `I`: 1000 flattened images,
* `IG`: same images converted to grayscale,
* `h` and `w`: height and widht (484x644),
* `I2`, `IG2`, `w2` and `h2`: same as above but images are scaled and cropped to (64x64).
